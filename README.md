# Netflix-Project

## Overview
This project analyzes a Netflix dataset obtained from Kaggle, focusing on cleaning the data and creating visualizations to uncover trends and insights.

## Data Cleaning
The dataset had several duplicates and missing values. We addressed these issues by:
- Removing duplicate rows
- Filling missing values for non-essential fields like 'director' with 'Unknown'
- Dropping rows with critical missing information, such as 'cast' and 'country'
## Conclusion
- The dataset is predominantly made up of movies rather than TV shows.
- The USA and India are the top contributors of content on Netflix.
- There has been an increase in content over recent years, with the majority of titles released after 2000.
